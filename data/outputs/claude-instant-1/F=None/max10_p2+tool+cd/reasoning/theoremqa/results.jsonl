(Here R(r, s) signifies an integer that depends on both r and s.)\nRamsey's theorem is a foundational result in combinatorics. The first version of this result was proved by Frank Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions for the existence of substructures with regular properties. In this application it is a question of the existence of monochromatic subsets, that is, subsets of connected edges of just one colour.\nAn extension of this theorem applies to any finite number of colours, rather than just two. More precisely, the theorem states that for any given number of colours, c, and any given integers n1, \u2026, nc, there is a number, R(n1, \u2026, nc), such that if the edges of a complete graph of order R(n1, \u2026, nc) are coloured with c different colours, then for some i between 1 and c, it must contain a complete subgraph of order ni whose edges are all colour i. The special case above has c = 2 (and n1 = r and n2 = s).\nYou have 7 steps left and 1 chances to propose solution left.\n"}, "agent_action_count": {"propose_solution": 2, "use_tool": 2, "invalid_action": 0}, "token_counter": {}, "terminate_reason": "max_propose_steps", "error": null}, "task": {"task_name": "reasoning", "task_id": 8, "prompt": "Answer the following question with a number, a list of numbers or True or False.
